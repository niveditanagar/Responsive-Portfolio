            Hello global citizens! My name is Nivedita Nagar (also known as Nivi) and I'm switchig my career to programming. I graduated
            with a Psychology degree and wanted to become a neuropsychologist.
            <br> Unfortunately, there were no jobs available for me. I got tired of waiting for an opportunity so I took matters
            into my own hands.
            <br> The result?... Here I am in this bootcamp trying to learn this mystery (at least for now) called coding.
            <br> For the next three months I will have to eat, breathe, walk, and talk coding. It is true what they say...you
            must believe in yourself.
             Once this bootcamp is over and I secure a job, I can get back to doing my most beloved hobbies.
             If you want to know what I like doing on the side then let me tell you what exactly are my hobbies.
            <br> I love to read, go to the movies, and hanging out with friends/family. I'm a major movie addict and all though I love all genres, my favorite
            has to be action adventure.
